    <h1>Some spots on the internet I enjoy!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The internet is pretty full of abysmal dogshit these days so here's a few websites I lik:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://canvas.berklee.edu/">Berklee Canvas</a>
            <p>What a great website, i love spending time on it</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~Hooven">My RateYourMusic Profile</a>
            <p>RYM has its flaws but I like it more than basically any other Music related websites <br>
            Its database is incredible, you could dig through there finding new stuff to check out forever. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://sunriseoverpripyat.bandcamp.com/track/clockwork-soul">My Band's Latest Release on Bandcamp</a>
            <p>I think a great use for the internet is buying my friend Alys and I's band's latest single.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
